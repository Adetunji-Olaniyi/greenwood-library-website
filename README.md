It currently includes basic section: Home, About US, Events, and Contact US. Your team decided to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section. while "Jamie" will update the "Events" page with new community events.

## Objectives
